/*
  SD card read/write
 
 This example shows how to read and write data to and from an SD card file 	
 The circuit:
 * SD card attached to SPI bus as follows:
 ** MOSI - pin 11
 ** MISO - pin 12
 ** CLK - pin 13
 ** CS - pin 4

// or the SD library functions will not work.

  // that are connected to the SPI bus do not hold drive bus
