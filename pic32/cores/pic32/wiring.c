    uint32_t CoreTimerService(uint32_t count)

    A CoreTimer Service is a callback routine that will get called when the core timer value equals the last value returned by your service; 
    also known as your requested compare time. When registering a CoreTimerService callback routine, the routine will be called on the next regularly 
    scheduled event currently waiting the CoreTimerHandler. From system start, there is a millisecond CoreTimerService running, so in most cases once you 
    register your callback serivce it should be called within 1 ms of attaching (registering). In some cases if interrupts are diaabled it may be as 
    long as 50 ms before your first call is made. Passed in to your Service is the current value of the CoreTimer count register, this is a rolling count 
    that rolls once every 2^32 / 40000000 ~ 107seconds. The return value from your service should be the next value of count that you want to be notified; 
    logically like setting the compare register; however, CoreTimerHandler is managing several services and will notify you when your value has been hit. 
    You will totally screw up CoreTimerHandler if you set the compare register directly. Here are the rules for writing a CoreTimerService callback routine.

    The rules:

    1.	You do NOT set "compare"!
    2.  Do not do anything that could cause CoreTimerHandler to be called recursively. For example, do not enable interrupts as the CT flag is still set
        and will immeditely cause the system to call CoreTimerHandler.
    3.	The value of the count register is passed to you, however this could be several ticks old. Usually this is not a problem. It is allowed 
        for you to read the count register directly, however you must return a compare value that is greater in time (so it can be a uint32 wrapped value) 
        than the count value passed to you. 
    4.	You will NOT be called before your compare value has been hit; however you may be called late should interrupts get disabled.
    5.	Unfortunately, because of things like the EEProm writes, you can be called late and you must "catch-up" however best you can and return 
        the next requested "compare" time on your next call.
    6.	There are limits to how far in the future you can set your next "compare" time. Right now this is limited to 90 seconds. If you need a longer delay you
        should be using something other than a CoreTimer Services to do this. You probably should really limit your next "compare" time to less than few seconds.
    7.	Your next requested "compare" time MUST be equal to or after (in time) the "current" time as passed in to you. You may add up to 90 seconds to the 
        current time, even if this causes uint32 wrap; but do not subtract from the current time and return that. There is a region known to CoreTimerHandler 
        that is before the current time, but that uint32 "value" is after the current time + 90 seconds.
     8.	CoreTimerHandler will keep looping until count is less than whatever the next compare is "after" CT was cleared to insure that CT is not missed. 
        It is possible that you could be called a second time before exiting the CoreTimerHandler ISR if you request a new compare time that is very close to 
        the current time.
    9.	After attaching, your service will be called on the next schedule call to CoreTimerHandler. Since there is always a ms service that gets triggered, 
        this will typically mean your first call to your Service will be within 1 ms of attaching, unless interrupts are disabled and you are delayed; 
        it could then be as much as 50ms.
    10. Understand, your callback is being called while executing inside the CoreTimerHandler ISR. Your code should be as fast as possible. If too much
        time is taken, the ISR may never exit and no sketch will ever run!
